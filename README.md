# Matthew Hinze's Online Portfolio #

Hello! And welcome to my github Repository. Its a bit baren now but as time progresses I'll be looking to add more of my projects, both past and future.

# Projects By Folder #

BACS 200 Class Website: This website was created from using HTML5 and CSS in the text editor Notepad++. Note: There are spaces of filler text that were intentionally left incomplete. To view the project, download the folder's entire subdirectory, and simply run the "index.html" file. Just be sure too keep the current file structure intact.
