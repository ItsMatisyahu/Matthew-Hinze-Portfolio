	<h1>Our Purpose</h1>
	
	<p>The main goal of Organization XIII is to summmon Kingdom Hearts, the powerful entity that will give us the ability to reform the hearts misssing from inside of us. In order to reach this goal, we must give Kingdom Hearts the concentrated darkness that resides inside of beings. This darkness mainfests itself in the hearts of other beings known as heartless. (Seen below)

		<p><b>Heartless</b><br>The heartless are beings made from pure darkness, and are created when the darkness that resides in someones heart is released. Despite their name, Heartless contain pure, dark hearts" that are necessary to creating Kingdom Hearts. The keyblade posessed by Roxas is the one weapon that can properly harvest these dark hearts and give them Kingdom Hearts.</p>

		<p><b>Nobodies</b><br>Nobodies are created concurrently when a heartless is formed. We have no hearts, and belong to neither the light nor the darkness. Us members all have control over the lesser Nobodies, such as the one seen to the left. They serve as minions in our quest to summon Kingdom Hearts.
