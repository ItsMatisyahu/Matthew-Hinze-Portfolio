		</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3><b>Xigbar - II</b></h3>
	<div class="member">
	<img src="Assets/member_xigbar.png" alt="A picture of the Organization XIII member Xigbar" />
		<p><b>Nickname - </b>The Freeshooter<br><b>Attribute - </b>Space<br><b>Weapon – </b>Arrowguns: <i>Sharpshooters</i><br><b>Previous Self - </b>Braig<br><b>Bio – </b>Braig is the second member to join Organization XII.

	<div class="member">
		<img src="Assets/member_xaldin.png" alt="A picture of the Organization XIII member Xaldin" />

		Self - </b>Dilan<br><b>Bio – </b>Xaldin is the third member to join Organization XII. He controls the attribute wind, which when combined with the use of his 6 <i>Lindworm</i> lances, creates a powerful force not to be reckoned with.

	<div class="member">
		<img src="Assets/member_saix.png" alt="A picture of the Organization XIII member Saix" />

		</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3><b>Demyx - IX</b></h3>
	<div class="member">
		<img src="Assets/member_demyx.png" alt="A picture of the Organization XIII member Demyx" />

		</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3><b>Marluxia - XI</b></h3>
	<div class="member">
		<img src="Assets/member_marluxia.png" alt="A picture of the Organization XIII member Marluxia" />

		</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3><b>Larxene - XII</b></h3>
	<div class="member">
		<img src="Assets/member_larxene.png" alt="A picture of the Organization XIII member Larxene" />

		</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3><b>Roxas - XIII</b></h3>

His Keyblade harvests the hearts from Heartless, and every Strike of his weapon brings Kingdom Hearts ever closer to our grasp.  
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3><b>Xion*</b></h3>
	<div class="member">
		<img src="Assets/member_xion.png" alt="A picture of the Organization XIII member Xion" />
